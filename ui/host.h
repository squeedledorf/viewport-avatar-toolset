// Viewport Avatar Toolset - what the shared UI (vats_ui) needs from the program it runs in.

//
// Two hosts implement this: the standalone app (app/sdl_host.*: SDL3 window, its own OpenGL scene
// renderer) and an SL viewer (spec 09 stages U2-U3). The UI never includes SDL or a renderer;
// everything platform- or renderer-specific comes through here. Spec: docs/spec/09 section 0b.
//
// Not here on purpose:
// - Clipboard: ImGui's own (ImGui::GetClipboardText / SetClipboardText) through its PlatformIO hooks,
//   which each host's ImGui platform glue already sets.
// - Input, frame pacing and the ImGui context: the host creates the context, feeds input, and calls
//   App::frame() between ImGui::NewFrame() and ImGui::Render(). App::frame() returning false is the
//   UI's "quit" (the viewer closes the editor); App::request_quit() is the host's close button.
