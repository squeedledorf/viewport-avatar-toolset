# What's new in 0.1.0

## Posing
- **IK** for arms, legs, wings, hind legs, fingers and the spine. Press K on a limb to switch between IK and FK without a jump.
- **Hold and bind**: hold a point still in the world, or bind it to another bone so it follows (set a drink down, pass it to the other hand, a two-handed weapon).
- **Hand poser** (H): drag a finger dot down to curl it, sideways to spread it. Starter hand and body poses are in the Inventory.
- **Your own mesh body**: import a devkit's rigged parts under Inventory > Bodies.

## Animating
- **Graph editor** (Ctrl+G) with every tangent type, box select, scaling and an Euler filter.
- **Poses and clips** in the Inventory, pasted mirrored onto the other side when you need them.
- Mirror, flip and reverse whole animations.
- **Couples and groups** (Tools > Actors): several avatars on one timeline, one .anim each.

## Bringing motion in
- **Retargeting** (File > Import Animation (Retarget)): Mixamo, Unreal, VRM, Rigify and mocap files as BVH, glTF or FBX, fitted under SL's limits.
- **Motion capture** (Tools > Motion Capture): live from webcam and VR tracker apps that send VMC.

## Making motion
- **Dynamics** (Tools > Dynamics): tails, ears, hair and jiggle that swing behind the animation, baked to keys.
- **Ragdoll** (Tools > Ragdoll): let the body or a limb fall limp, then bake it.

## Exporting
- **.anim files the viewer reads exactly** as it reads its own, checked against the viewer's own rules before they are written.
- BVH export and import for other tools.
- Naming patterns and an export folder in the Export section, so exporting takes one click.

## Where your work lives
- Projects are plain .vat files.
- Settings, autosaves and your libraries are kept in your user folder.
