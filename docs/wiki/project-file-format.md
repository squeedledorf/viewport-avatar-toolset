# Project file format

A VATs project (`.vat`) is a UTF-8 JSON file that holds everything about an animation: its curves,
timing, props, pins, simulations, audio and actors. The app and the
[[VATs Editor (viewer)|VATs Editor]] read and write the same format. This page is a reference for
people who read or generate project files with their own tools.

Project files and libraries saved by versions from before the rename, with their older extension and
`format` names, still open; saving them writes the current `format` names.

## Format

A project is one JSON object. VATs writes the fields below; readers must accept them in any order.

```
{
  "format": "vats-project",
  "version": 1,
  "euler_order": "xyz-extrinsic",
  "fps": 30,
  "end_frame": 30,
  "loop": false,
  "loop_in": 0,
  "loop_out": 30,
  "priority": 3,
  "ease_in": 0.8,
  "ease_out": 0.8,
  "hand_pose": 1,
  "emote": "",
  "mirror_export": false,
  "export": {},
  "curves": {
    "mShoulderLeft": { "rot_z": [[0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [15, 40, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]] }
  },
  "props": [],
  "anchors": [],
  "meta": {}
}
```

### Header

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `format` | `"vats-project"` |
| `version` | `1` for a project with one actor and one clip, `2` for two or more actors and one clip (see actors below), `3` for a project with a clip list (see clips below) |
| `euler_order` | `"xyz-extrinsic"`, the only order: a rotation `(x, y, z)` in degrees is X applied first, then Y, then Z |
| `meta` | a free-form object, always kept |

A file with a higher `version` than VATs knows opens with a warning and is saved only under a new name.

### Timing and export

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `fps` | int | `30` | frames per second, 1–120 |
| `end_frame` | int | `30` | last frame, 0–3600 |
| `loop` | bool | `false` | the animation loops |
| `loop_in`, `loop_out` | int | `0`, `end_frame` | loop points, in frames |
| `priority` | int | `3` | [[Animation priority]], 0–6 |
| `joint_priority` | object | absent | per-joint priority overrides, `{ "mHead": 4 }` |
| `ease_in`, `ease_out` | number | `0.8` | seconds |
| `hand_pose` | int | `1` | Second Life's hand pose, 0–13 |
| `emote` | string | `""` | the facial emote played with the animation |
| `mirror_export` | bool | `false` | the export is mirrored left to right |
| `export` | object | `{}` | export settings (below) |
| `ik_solve` | string | absent | `"literal"`: IK uses the literal two-bone frame instead of lining the mid joint up with the pole |
| `ik_pull` | object | absent | each IK target's **Pull**, 0–1, by limb: `{ "ArmRight": 1 }`; absent targets have 0 (see [[IK#Full-body reach]]) |

The `export` object holds the settings of **File → Export**: `name`, `number`, `side`, `pattern`,
`folder`, `both`, `count_up`, the body `shape` (default `"sl-default"`), `reduce` as an array
`[degrees, metres]` of key-reduction tolerances, and `bvh_positions`.

### curves

`curves` is an object keyed by track, and each track is an object keyed by channel. Each channel is an
array of keys. Empty channels and tracks are not written.

| Track | Channels |
|---|---|
| a bone name, such as `mPelvis` | `rot_x`, `rot_y`, `rot_z` in degrees; `pos_x`, `pos_y`, `pos_z` in metres, as an offset from the rest position |
| an attachment point name, such as `Left Hand` | the same; the rotation is on top of the point's rest rotation |
| `ik.<Limb>`, such as `ik.ArmLeft` | `blend` (0–1; above 0 at any key means [[IK]] is used), `pos_*` the target position, `rot_*` the target rotation, `pole_*` the pole point |
| `pin:<joint>` | `rot_*` and `pos_*`, an extra offset on top of a pin's held transform |

Each key is an array of nine numbers:

| Index | Field | Values |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | frame | a number; fractions are allowed |
| 1 | value | degrees, metres or blend |
| 2 | interpolation of the segment after the key | `0` constant, `1` linear, `2` bezier |
| 3, 4 | left and right handle type | `0` auto-clamped, `1` auto, `2` vector, `3` aligned, `4` free, `5` flat, `6` plateau |
| 5–8 | left handle x, y, right handle x, y | absolute (frame, value) |

On load, VATs recomputes the handles of every key whose handle type is not aligned or free, so the
stored handles of those keys are ignored.

### key_tags

The [[Keys and timeline#Blocking and key tags|key tags]], when any key has one. `key_tags` is keyed by track and
channel like `curves`, and each channel is a string of two hex digits (one byte) per key, in the channel's key
order: `00` none, `01` Extreme, `02` Breakdown, `03` Hold. Channels with no tagged key are left out:

```
"key_tags": { "mShoulderLeft": { "rot_z": "0102" } }
```

A project without `key_tags` loads with no tags. A channel whose string does not have one byte per key, or that
holds a value above `03`, loads with no tags; the rest of the project loads as usual.

### selection_sets

The [[Picker]]'s selection sets, when there are any: an array of `{ "name": "Right Arm", "bones": ["mShoulderRight",
"mElbowRight"] }`. Each actor of a group scene has its own, in its `clip` object. Bones the skeleton lacks are kept
and skipped when the set is recalled.

### props

An array of [[Props|props]], each with `path`, `name`, `bone`, `point`, `pos` (metres), `rot` (degrees),
`scale`, `visible`, `rigged` and `lib_id`. The app writes `path` relative to the project file when the
prop is on the same drive, and absolute otherwise.

### anchors

An array of pins (see [[Hold and bind]]):

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `joint` | the pinned joint or attachment point |
| `via` | the joint moved to hold it |
| `target` | the bone it rides; `""` holds it in the world |
| `from`, `to` | the first and last held frame; `to` of `-1` is open-ended |
| `pos`, `rot` | the held position (metres) and rotation (quaternion `x, y, z, w`) relative to the target |
| `start_key`, `release_key` | optional frames of helper keys VATs made |
| `target_actor` | optional: the actor whose bone it rides |

### dynamics

An array of [[Dynamics]] chains, each with `root`, `length`, `stiffness`, `damping`, `drag`, `gravity`,
`radius` and `baked`. A baked chain also has `source`: the chain's tracks from before the bake, in the
`curves` layout. A chain baked with **Bake Bounce into Keys** also has `physics`: SL's avatar physics settings for its
part, `mass`, `gravity`, `drag`, and `updown`, `inout` and `leftright`, each with `max_effect`, `spring`, `gain` and
`damping`.

### idle

An array of [[Idle layer|idle layers]], each with `kind` (`"breath"` or `"sway"`), `amplitude` (degrees),
`period` (seconds, before snapping), `seed`, `bones` (an array of bone names) and `baked`. A baked layer
also has `source`: its bones' tracks from before the bake, in the `curves` layout.

### ragdoll

The [[Ragdoll]], when set up: `whole_body`, `bones`, `start`, `frames`, `blend_in`, `blend_out`,
`gravity`, `stiffness`, `friction`, `baked`, and `source` when baked. `fall_direction` is one of
`"forward"`, `"back"`, `"left"`, `"right"`, `"random"` or `"none"`; absent means forward.

### face_layer

The blink, eye-dart and look-at layer of [[Face animation]], when added: `seed`, `blinks`, `blink_min`,
`blink_max`, `blink_length` (seconds), `saccades`, `saccade_interval` (seconds), `eye_limit` (degrees), `look`
(`""`, `"point"`, `"prop"`, `"camera"` or `"actor"`), `point` (`[x, y, z]`, metres), `prop` (a prop's name),
`actor` and `bone` (`""` is between the eyes), `head_share`, `head_max` (degrees), `baked`, `head_baked`, and
`source` when baked: the eye, eyelid and head tracks from before the bake.

### lip_sync

The [[Lip sync]], when keyed: `from` and `to` (the keyed frames), `positions` (whether **Move face bones** was on),
`cues` (an array of `{frame, shape}`, each shape held until the next; shapes are the names in
`data/retarget/lip-shapes.json`) and `level` (from the audio: the loudness, 0–1, on each frame from `from` to
`to`; empty for Rhubarb). The keys themselves are in `curves`; this is what the timeline shows and what a nudge
or **Remove Lip Sync** keys again from.

### audio

The [[Audio track]], when there is one: `path` (relative like props), `offset`, `volume`, `bpm`,
`beat_offset`, `beats` (an array of marked beats) and `snap`.

### reference

The [[Reference images|reference image]], when there is one: `path` (relative like props; for a sequence, one of
its pictures), `sequence`, `in_scene`, `hidden`, `view` (`"any"`, `"front"`, `"back"`, `"right"`, `"left"` or
`"top"`), `opacity` (0 to 1), `scale`, `offset` (`[right, up]`), `flip_x`, `flip_y`, `frame_offset` (the timeline
frame the first picture shows on) and `fps` (the sequence's own rate). An unknown `view` fails the load.

### Imported data

- `constraints`: the constraint blocks of an imported `.anim`, each a hex string of 86 bytes, written
  back unchanged on export.
- `orphans`: imported `.anim` joints that are not in the skeleton, each with `name`, `priority`, `rot`
  (`[seconds, x, y, z, w]` keys) and `pos` (`[seconds, x, y, z]` keys), written back unchanged on export.

### actors

A project with two or more actors (see [[Couples and groups]]) has version `2` and an `actors` array.
Each actor has `name`, `colour` (`[r, g, b]`), `body`, `pos` (metres), `rot_z`, `hidden` and `locked`.
The active actor's animation is the top level of the file, and `active` is its index. Every other actor
has a `clip` object with the same fields as the top level: timing, curves, props, anchors and the rest.
`fps`, `end_frame` and the loop settings are shared: the active actor's values apply to all.

### clips

A project with a clip list (see [[Clips]]) has version `3`, a `clips` array and `active_clip`, the index of the
clip being edited. Each entry has `name`, `ao_state` (the AO state for the notecards; left out when there is
none) and, for every clip but the active one, a `clip` object with the same fields as the top level. The active
clip is the top level of the file, as for actors. In a project with actors as well, the active actor's clips are
these; every other actor has a `clips` array with one clip object per entry, and `{}` at `active_clip`, whose
animation is that actor's `clip`. A project that has never had a second clip, or a named clip, has no `clips` and
keeps version `1` or `2`; older projects open as one clip called `Clip`.

### mesh_looks

What each mesh body shows ([[Rig any model#Parts and shape keys]]), by the body's id: `"mesh_looks": {"body-123":
{"hidden": ["Scarf"], "shape_keys": {"Body - Obese": 1}}}`. `hidden` lists the parts hidden and `shape_keys` the
values set (0–1; a key left out is at its file's value); either is left out when empty. A body with no entry shows
what its models' mapping files say.

### View settings

`onion` holds the [[Onion skin]] settings of the project.

### Unknown fields

VATs keeps every field it does not know, at the top level, in each actor and clip, and in pins, chains,
idle layers, the ragdoll, the face layer, the audio track and the reference image, and writes them back on save. A tool can store its
own data in a project this way; a name with a prefix of its own avoids clashes with later VATs fields.

## Usage

### Saving safely

The app writes a project to a temporary file and renames it over the old one, so a failed save never
leaves half a file. The previous version is kept as `<name>.vat.bak`.

## Troubleshooting

### "not a VATs project (format is missing or unknown)"

The file has no `format` field, or an unknown one. Check that it is a VATs project and not a pose or
prop library.

### "unsupported euler_order"

The file uses another rotation order. Convert the rotations to `xyz-extrinsic`.

### A prop or the audio file is missing after moving the project

Relative paths are relative to the project file. Move the prop, audio and reference files with the project, keeping
their place relative to it.
