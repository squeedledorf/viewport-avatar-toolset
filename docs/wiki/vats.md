# VATs

Viewport Avatar Toolset is an open-source editor for Second Life avatar animations. You pose the Bento
skeleton on a timeline, preview the motion on the Linden avatar or a mesh body, and export a `.anim`
or `.bvh` file that Second Life accepts. VATs is free software under the GNU Lesser General Public
License 2.1.

## App and viewer

VATs comes in two forms that share the same core code and the same project files:

| | App | Viewer |
|---|---|---|
| Name | Viewport Avatar Toolset | VATs Editor |
| Runs | on its own, on Linux and Windows | inside an SL viewer, from the **Avatar** menu |
| Avatar | the Linden avatar or a mesh body from your library | your own avatar, as you wear it, playing the clip live |
| Output | `.vat` projects, `.anim` and `.bvh` files; upload with any viewer | the same files; **File → Upload Animation...** uploads directly |

Features are kept the same in both wherever the viewer allows it. Where a feature differs, its page
says so in a note. See [[VATs Editor (viewer)]] for what differs in the viewer.
