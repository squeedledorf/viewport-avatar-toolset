# Projects and files

VATs saves your work as a `.vat` project: the animation with every key, the props, the audio track,
the actors, the [[Clips]] and the export settings. It keeps a backup of the previous save, autosaves unsaved work,
and offers that work back after a crash. Your libraries and settings live in data folders in your
home folder, separate from projects.

## Usage

### Saving

- **File → Save** (**Ctrl+S**) writes the project to its file. A project without a file asks for a
  name first.
- **File → Save As...** (**Ctrl+Shift+S**; **Ctrl+A** in QAvimator) saves under a new name. The dialog
  starts beside the current project, and VATs adds `.vat` when the name has no extension.
- **File → Save to Library...** asks only for a name and saves into the Projects library, listed in the
  **Inventory** ([[Project library]]).

Each save writes a temporary file and then renames it over the project, so a failed save never leaves
half a file. The previous version is kept beside it as `<name>.vat.bak`, replacing the older
backup. If the save fails, the **Save failed** message gives the reason, and the file on disk is
unchanged.

Prop meshes and the audio file are stored relative to the project where possible, so a project folder
can be moved or copied with its files. This holds for every clip and every actor of the project.

A project can hold several clips, such as the animations of an AO set; **Tools → Clips (AO Sets)...** lists them.
**Save** writes them all into the one file, and opening it returns to the clip that was being edited. A project
from before clips opens as one clip called `Clip`. See [[Clips]].

The title bar shows `*` after the file name while there are unsaved changes.

### Worked example: save, change, save again

[Open the example](example:first-wave.vat). It opens as an untitled copy, so nothing here touches
the shipped file:

1. Press **Ctrl+Shift+S** (**Save As...**) and save it as `wave-test` in an empty folder. VATs adds
   `.vat`; the status bar says `Saved wave-test.vat` and the title bar shows the name without `*`.
2. Untick **Loop** in **Properties → Animation**. The title bar shows `wave-test.vat*`.
3. Press **Ctrl+S**. The folder now holds two files: `wave-test.vat`, the save with the loop off,
   and `wave-test.vat.bak`, the save before it, with the loop on.
4. To check the backup, rename `wave-test.vat.bak` to `wave-test-before.vat` and open it with
   **Ctrl+O**: **Loop** is ticked.

### Opening

- **File → Open...** (**Ctrl+O**) opens a VATs project (`.vat`).
- **File → Open Recent** lists up to 10 recent projects, newest first, numbered. Files that no longer
  exist are hidden. **Clear Recent** empties the list.
- Double-click a project or `.anim` file in the **Projects** and **Animations** sections of the
  **Inventory** ([[Project library]]).
- Drop a file on the VATs window: a project opens, a `.anim` or `.bvh` file is imported, a `.dae`
  or `.fbx` file is added as a prop, a `.gltf` or `.glb` file opens the [[Retargeting|retarget]] dialog,
  and a `.wav`, `.mp3`, `.ogg` or `.flac` file is loaded as the [[Audio track]].
- Name files on the [[Command line]]: they are opened the same way.

Only one project is open at a time. Opening, importing an animation or **File → New** with unsaved
changes asks `Save changes to <name>?` with **Save**, **Don't Save** and **Cancel**. **Save** on a
project that has never been saved opens **Save As...**; once it has saved, the command you started
goes on. Cancelling **Save As...** cancels the command too.

When you close the window or press **Ctrl+Q**, VATs asks the same question.

### Special cases when opening

| Case | What VATs does |
|---|---|
| A project that ships with VATs (the help's examples, anything in the installed `help`, `data` or `assets` folders) | opens as an untitled copy, however it is opened (**File → Open**, **Open Recent**, a dropped file, the [[Command line]], the help's **Open the example**), and is not added to **Open Recent**. The status bar says `Opened <file> (an example: Save As to keep your changes)`; **Save** asks for a new name, so the shipped file never changes. |
| A project saved by a newer VATs | opens what it can and shows **Newer project file**. **Save** asks for a new name, so the original stays whole. |
| Prop meshes missing | opens anyway and lists them in **Some prop meshes are missing**. The props show as orange boxes until the files are back. |
| An unreadable file | shows **Could not open project** with the reason; the open project is unchanged. |

### Autosave

While there are unsaved changes, VATs writes a copy of the project to the data folder one minute
after the first change, and again every two minutes while changes remain. Autosave does not touch
your project file.

The autosave is removed when you save, open or start another project, or quit normally (including
**Don't Save**). If the system stops VATs (logout, shutdown, a `SIGTERM`), VATs writes the autosave
at once and keeps it.

### Recovering after a crash

When VATs starts and finds an autosave from a session that did not end cleanly, the **Recover unsaved
work** window lists it with the project name (or `Untitled`) and its age:

- **Recover** opens it as unsaved work, with its original file name. The status bar says
  `Recovered <name>: save it to keep it`.
- **Discard** deletes that autosave.
- **Later** (or **Esc**) keeps them all and asks again at the next start.

Only one autosave is recovered at a time; the others are offered at the next start. The recovered
work is autosaved again before the old copy is deleted, so a second crash still leaves it.

> **Note:** An autosave is offered only once it is five minutes old, since a younger one may belong to
> a copy of VATs that is still running. After a crash, if the window does not appear, start VATs
> again a few minutes later.

## Data folders

| What | Linux | Windows |
|---|---|---|
| Settings (`settings.json`) | `~/.config/viewport-avatar-toolset/` | `%APPDATA%\viewport-avatar-toolset\` |
| Libraries, autosaves, window layout | `~/.local/share/viewport-avatar-toolset/` | `%APPDATA%\viewport-avatar-toolset\` |

On Linux the folders follow `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and `$XDG_DATA_HOME` when they are set. The project had
another name before it was called Viewport Avatar Toolset; on the first start after an update, the
folders an earlier version wrote under that name move here (only when the new folder does not exist
yet), with the settings, libraries, autosaves and window layout in them. The data folder
holds:

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `library/poses.json` | the pose library: poses and clips ([[Pose library]]) |
| `library/library.json` | the prop library ([[Props]]) |
| `library/bodies.json` | your mesh bodies ([[Mesh bodies]]) |
| `library/Projects/`, `library/Animations/` | the Inventory's project and animation libraries ([[Project library]]) |
| `library/*.png` | Inventory thumbnails |
| `faces/` | face tables for your own heads ([[Face animation#Head and Move face bones]]) |
| `retarget/` | your saved retarget mappings ([[Retargeting#Save a mapping]]) |
| `autosave/` | autosaves, a `.vat` and a `.path` file per session |
| `layout.ini` | the panel layout |

Copy the `library` folder to back up your libraries. If the pose or prop library cannot be read,
VATs renames it to `poses.json.corrupt-<number>` or `library.json.corrupt-<number>`, says so, and
starts an empty one, so the damaged file is never overwritten.

### Keeping everything in one folder

`--data-dir <dir>` puts settings, layout, autosaves and libraries all in `<dir>`, for example on a USB
stick. `--library-dir <dir>` moves only the libraries. See [[Command line]].

## Troubleshooting

### "Save failed"

The folder is read-only, the disk is full, or the file is open elsewhere (Windows). The message gives
the system's reason. Save to another folder with **Save As...**.

### My changes are gone after a crash

Start VATs again after five minutes and check the **Recover unsaved work** window. Changes made after the last autosave, up to
two minutes of work, are not in it. The `.vat.bak` file beside the project holds the save before the
last one: rename it to `.vat` to open it.

### Props show as orange boxes

VATs cannot find the prop mesh files. Put them back at the path shown in **Some prop meshes are
missing**, then open the project again.
