// Spec: docs/spec/08 section 6 (RG-1, RG-13). Written from the papers, no code taken from anywhere:
// - Bone heat: I. Baran and J. Popovic, "Automatic Rigging and Animation of 3D Characters", SIGGRAPH 2007, section 4.
//   Each bone's weight w is the steady heat over the surface, -Laplacian(w) + H w = H p: a vertex's nearest bone heats it
//   (p = 1 for that bone) with strength H = c / d^2 when the straight line from the vertex to the bone stays inside the
//   body (crosses no surface), else 0, and heat diffuses over the surface between.
// - The Laplacian: N. Sharp and K. Crane, "A Laplacian for Nonmanifold Triangle Meshes", SGP 2020: the intrinsic
//   Delaunay cotangent Laplacian of the mesh's tufted cover, its edge lengths mollified first. It has no negative
//   weights, so the heat stays between 0 and 1 and smooth on holes, non-manifold edges, overlapping and degenerate
//   triangles and separate pieces, where the plain cotangent Laplacian does not.
// Geodesic voxel binding (voxel distances from the skeleton through the body) is deliberately not used here.
