// range's ends, at `keep`, at the extrema (turns by more than the tolerance) and at the steepest frame between
// two of them (the inflection), then added where the fit misses. Between keys the curve is Auto (clamped) where
// that fits, else Free handles on the curve's own slope. The rotation of a track whose rot_y comes within 5 degrees
// of +-90 (gimbal lock: X and Z swing wildly there while the bone turns smoothly; a knee bent past a right angle) is
// fitted as a rotation: its channels together, with keys on the same frames, to the turn between the rotations. A
// curve whose fit would not have fewer keys and one with stepped keys in the range are left as they are. Keys just
// outside the range hold the curve there, as Filter Curves does.
