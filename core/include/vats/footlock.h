// After Kovar, Schreiner and Gleicher, "Footskate cleanup for motion capture editing" (SCA 2002). Each foot
// has two contact points: the heel (the ankle) and the toe (mToeLeft/Right; the ankle only when the skeleton
// has no toe bones or heel_toe is off). A contact is a run of frames where a point is near the ground and
// barely moving. The ground is the lowest sole point over the range: each point's height minus its height
// above the floor at rest. A planted point is snapped onto the ground and held there with the leg's IK: the
// target is the ankle, placed so the held point stays put while the foot turns as animated, and the IK blend
// ramps in and out around each stance, so the fix is ordinary IK data that export bakes like any other. (A pin
// would move the ankle itself and stretch the leg.) Where the leg cannot reach a target with its knee still
// bent kMinKneeBendDeg from rest, the pelvis is lowered by the shortfall on a smoothed curve (mPelvis pos_z
// keys) instead of straightening the knee.
